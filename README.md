# What is this mod?
This is a mod for a game called "NEET Girl Date Night" that allows you to generate dialogues and replace the game's original dialogues with the generated dialogues.

# Setup
You need to have the "NEET Girl Date Night" game (which can be downloaded from https://hitsujigoods.itch.io/ngdn).
### For Windows:
1) Download all two files and a folder named 'assets' from the 'build-version-for-windows' folder.
2) Drag them into the 'NEET_Girl_Date_Night-1.1-win' folder.
3) Then run 'NEET_Girl_Date_Night_Random_Dialogue_Generator_Mod.exe' file.

### For macOS:
This mod is currently available for Windows only. Sorry macOS users.\
I personally have never used macOS, but I will try to make this mod work for macOS in the future.
