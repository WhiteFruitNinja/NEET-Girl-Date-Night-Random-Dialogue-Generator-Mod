# What is this mod?
This is a mod for a game called "NEET Girl Date Night" that allows you to generate dialogues and replace the game's original dialogues with the generated dialogues.

# Setup
You need to have the "NEET Girl Date Night" game (which can be downloaded from https://hitsujigoods.itch.io/ngdn).
### For Windows:
1) Click on releases and look for a release that has "Latest" green text color near title.

2) On that release, click on Source code (zip) or (tar.gz) to download.

4) Extract 
1) Select all two files and a folder named 'assets' from the 'build-version-for-windows' folder.
2) Drag them into the 'NEET_Girl_Date_Night-1.1-win' folder.
3) Then run 'NEET_Girl_Date_Night_Random_Dialogue_Generator_Mod.exe' file.
4) When you run the application, Windows SmartScreen might appear due to a lack of users running the application and because the application has an unknown publisher according to Microsoft. Press 'More info' and then 'Run anyway'.

<p align="center">I have uploaded the source code for the mod in the 'source-for-windows' folder for those who are curious.</p>

### For macOS:
This mod is currently available for Windows only. Sorry macOS users.\
I personally have never used macOS, but I will try to make this mod work for macOS in the future.
