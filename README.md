# What is this mod?
This is a mod for a game called "NEET Girl Date Night" that allows you to generate dialogues and replace the game's original dialogues with the generated dialogues.

# Setup
You need to have the "NEET Girl Date Night" game (which can be downloaded from https://hitsujigoods.itch.io/ngdn).
### For Windows:
1) Download all two files and a folder named 'assets' from the 'build-version-for-windows' folder.
2) Drag them into the 'NEET_Girl_Date_Night-1.1-win' folder.
3) Then run 'NEET_Girl_Date_Night_Random_Dialogue_Generator_Mod.exe' file.
4) When you run the application, the Windows SmartScreen might appear due to lack of users running the application and application having an unknown publisher according to Microsoft. Press 'More info' and then 'Run Anyway'.

I have uploaded a source code for the mod in 'source-for-windows' folder for those who are curious.

### For macOS:
This mod is currently available for Windows only. Sorry macOS users.\
I personally have never used macOS, but I will try to make this mod work for macOS in the future.
